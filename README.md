# Structuring-a-One-Page-Layout-Using-HTML-and-CSS-with-div-IDs
One-Page Layout with a Fixed Navbar, created using HTML and CSS. The layout consists of distinct sections, each separated by vibrant, contrasting colors. The design features a fixed navigation bar at the top, allowing users to easily navigate between different sections: Home, Services, Team, About, Reviews, Projects, and Plans.

When a navigation item is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section, offering a seamless browsing experience. The sections are colored in bright and bold shades, including red, yellow, cyan, lime green, brown, beige, and six more dynamic colors for a visually engaging experience. This simple yet effective structure is perfect for presenting content in a clear, organized, and user-friendly way.
